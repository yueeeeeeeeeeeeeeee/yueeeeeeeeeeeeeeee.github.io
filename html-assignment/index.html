   <p>1.My name is Yin Yue, my pronouns are she/her, I'm from northern part of China.I like playing video games (but not good at it), also I love spend my spare time at home and do whatever I want.</p>
   <p>2.I have no experience about this program before, I think it's interesting and cool but it's also very difficult for me. Because everything is new to me, so I hope I can work hard to finish all the courses, during this period if I can find my interest that would be great.</p>
